An Ecommerce FIlter Products page.

Step1: `git clone git@github.com:nabeelCpp/fathershop.git`.

Step2: `npm install`.

You can also download the build and run it by installing serve `npm install -g serve` and then `serve -s build` to run the build directly.

Apparently i have hosted my code to the live server as well.
